## Introduction
Git is an extremely flexible tool for managing files. You can use it to build applications, and have a full history of all the changes you have made. You can also use it to work as a team and piece together everyone's work into a full application. The tricky part is effectively handling each person's changes to the code base, and orchestrating the dance of getting their code and your code into the main application. We will have a refresher on Git, and look at some strategies that will make it as painless as possible to work as a team and use Git to manage source code.

## Git
Git is distributed version control system. This is different from older styles of control systems in that every person that clones the repository to their machine has the entire repository on their computer. You can find a very concise history [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).
